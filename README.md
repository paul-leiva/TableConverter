# TableConverter
This program takes a *.csv* file (comma-separated values file) as input and converts the file into equivalent HTML code for the table. A *.csv* file is a lot like an Excel workbook, but the values are stored in a file where each cell is separated by a comma (','). This makes it easy for file reading/writing processes.

# How it works
1. Run `TableConverter.java`.
2. You will be prompted to select your .csv file from the file chooser. The file can be in any directory.
3. Then, `TableConverter.java` will convert your .csv file into a file called `table.html` in this directory.
4. Upon opening `table.html`, you should see your .csv file converted into equivalent HTML code.
